Reading Type Puritan 2.0

1.  FONTLOG for Puritan
This file provides detailed information on the Puritan font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Puritan fonts and any derivative works.

2.  Basic Font Information
Puritan was drawn as a project while I was studying typography at the University of Reading, UK.
It was released without a license in 2001 (that release is considered version 1.0).
From version 2.0a, Puritan is still available freely but its use, distribution and reproduction is now governed by the terms of the SIL Open Font License. A copy is included with this distribution: see the License file.

There is a PDF describing the project in more detail on the site.
